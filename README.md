# Water-level-detector
This is my first project related to automation. It was made using Arduino UNO.

This project is a simple and efficient water level monitoring system designed using an Arduino Uno. It helps detect and indicate the water level in a tank or container, preventing overflow and dry-run conditions. The system uses water level sensors or conductive probes to determine the level of water and displays the results through LEDs and a buzzer.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:

The water level sensor or probes are placed at different heights inside the tank to detect various levels‚Äîlow, medium, and high. Each level corresponds to a specific LED indicator on the circuit. The system operates automatically and provides a clear visual representation of the water level status.

üß© Components Required:

Arduino Uno

Water level sensor or metal probes

LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)

Jumper wires and breadboard

üñ•Ô∏è Features:

Real-time monitoring of water levels

Visual (LED) alerts

Easy to assemble and program

Prevents motor dry-run and water overflow
